# 👋 Hi there, I'm Abdul Khader Mohammed

🎓 I'm currently in my 4th semester of the **Computer Programming** diploma at **Sault College**, with a cumulative average of **92%**. I’ve gained strong practical skills in software development, database systems, and full-stack web technologies through real-world projects and coursework.

🌱 I'm actively seeking **internship opportunities** in software or web development, where I can contribute to meaningful projects, grow alongside experienced developers, and bring my skills and passion for programming into a professional environment.
